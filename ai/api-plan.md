# REST API Plan

## 1. Resources
The API is designed based on the provided database schema, product requirements, and tech stack. The primary resources identified are:

- **Users**  
  Represents the `users` table. It stores user profile data such as user ID, name, email, password (hashed), roles, and timestamps. Validations include required fields and unique email constraints.

- **Products**  
  Corresponds to the `products` table. It contains product details including product ID, name, description, price, stock levels, and timestamps. Validations ensure that pricing and stock values are non-negative.

- **Orders**  
  Maps to the `orders` table. It links users and products by storing order details such as order ID, user identifier, product identifier, quantity, status, and order dates. Relationships enforce valid references between users and products, and indexes are applied to key fields for improved performance.

## 3. Authentication and Authorization
The API uses JWT-based authentication. Users receive a token upon successful registration or login, which must be included in the `Authorization` header of all subsequent requests to protected endpoints. Role-based access control is implemented to restrict actions such as creating, updating, or deleting products to administrators only. Secure communications are enforced via HTTPS, and rate limiting is applied to mitigate potential abuse.

## 4. Validation and Business Logic
Robust validation and business rules ensure data integrity and proper system behavior:
- **Users**:  
  - Mandatory fields: `name`, `email`, `password`.  
  - Email must be unique and correctly formatted.  
  - Passwords require a minimum strength and are stored after hashing.

- **Products**:  
  - Required fields include `name`, `price`, and `stock`.  
  - Validations ensure that `price` and `stock` are non-negative numbers.

- **Orders**:  
  - Must reference existing user and product records.  
  - Order placement validates product availability and reserves stock appropriately.  
  - Order updates are restricted based on the order status to enforce business rules.

Indexes on frequently queried fields (e.g., user email, product ID, order user reference) have been integrated at the database level to support efficient data retrieval. Pagination, filtering, and sorting are consistently applied across endpoints to optimize performance on list queries.

This plan aligns with the specified technology stack and provides a comprehensive, secure, and maintainable foundation for building the REST API.
